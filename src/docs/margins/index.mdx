## The Stack and the Infrastructure

### Backend [(Github)](https://github.com/alexliusq/margins-me-serverless-resources)

- EC2 Instance, running Docker. Used Docker Compose to deploy.
    - PostgreSQL (Dockerized): Full data security with RBAC and Row Level Security
        - Plan to migrate to Aurora
    - Express (Dockerized). Right now a GraphQL Server.
        - PostGraphile: [an amazing open source library](https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/) that I like better than Hasura, a VC-funded alternative, which programmatically generates a Relay-compliant GraphQL server which can easily be embedded in an Express Server
        - Self-generated RSA JWK to allow server-side applications securely access the Postgraphile server.
    - Nginx (Dockerized): Right now a reverse proxy, also chosen for potential load balancing without paying for an AWS ELB instance
        - TLS/SSL certificates thanks to [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), SSL Labs gave the [api.margins.me](http://api.margins.me) endpoint a [B grade](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=api.margins.me)
- AWS Cognito: Identity-as-a-Service, far cheaper alternative to Auth0. Every security expert says don't roll your own crypto, I think the same applies to my use case for Identity. I don't want to deal with different [Authentication Challenge flows](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/amazon-cognito-user-pools-authentication-flow.html)
    - AWS Lambda: Post-Confirmation trigger to add user info + onboarding to database
- AWS SES + S3 + Lambda + SAM: Lambda to check if email is registered, if so, SES writes email to S3, which then triggers a Lambda to parse the exported Kindle html file and post to GraphQL endpoint
    - Wrote package to extract attachment using [MailParser](https://mailparser.io/) and parsed the html using [Cheerio](https://cheerio.js.org/), which is essentially server-side jQuery
    - AWS SAM to locally test and deploy Lambda functions, after many bad experiences with Serverless Framework plugins, I needed something that just worked
- AWS Route53: DNS

### Frontend: [(Github)](https://github.com/alexliusq/margins-me-frontend)

- Netlify: React + Antd + Apollo + Gatsby
    - React because bigger community
    - Antd because Material UI is kind of ugly and I quite like the interfaces of many Ant products, like GaoDe, Alipay, etc.
    - Apollo because although their documentation isn't great, Relay's documentation is worse, and also is good enough to be used by AWS as part of their client side framework Amplify. Client-side caching, though a pain to implement, improves performance significantly.
    - Gatsby because it's a static site generator that makes sites blazingly fast thanks to out-of-the-box optimizations like prefetching and code-splitting. Also Gatsby sites can be deployed anywhere because it builds static files, whereas Next.js requires a server to run.
