# HIST 414, Therapeutic Transformations: The "Wonder Drugs" and Modern Medicine

## Final Paper: Biotech, Genentech, and Syntex
When conducting primary research for this paper, I came across this [Oral History of Kleiner Perkins and Genentech](https://oac.cdlib.org/view?docId=kt1p3010dc&query=&brand=oac4). A must read for anyone interested in the early days of Venture Capital and Biotech.

### Introduction
On October 14, 1980, the air crackled with anticipation on the stock market, before igniting into what the LA Times described as “a frenzy the likes of which hasn’t been seen on Wall Street since the go-go days of the 1960s.” The ringing of the opening bell barely ended before the stock skyrocketed from $35 to $80, peaking at $89 in twenty minutes, before closing at $71. The WSJ described it as “one of the most spectacular market debuts in recent history.”

The stock ticker was GENE, the company was Genentech, and the IPO sparked dreams of a multi-billion dollar industry, biotechnology. Biotech was meant to revolutionize medicine but the IPO demonstrated its potential to generate mind-boggling wealth – Swanson, a co-founder of Genentech, was described as “not a big man unless standing on his wallet.”

It is thus no surprise that much attention has focused not only on Genentech and the Biotech industry’s scientific achievements but its business innovations. Hughes describes “Genentech exemplified a novel corporate form and milieu for business in biology, notably different from anything the pharmaceutical industry offered.” Bugos states “As much as it was a hotbed of science, Genentech was a hotbed of financial innovation.”
Pisano, a Harvard Business School professor, notes that “Perhaps most critical, Genentech pioneered an entirely new business model for entrants into the pharmaceutical industry.”

Always mentioned in passing as the last Fully Integrated Pharmaceutical Company, or FIPCO, before Genentech is Syntex Corporation. Yet the venture capitalists behind Genentech, the co-founders9, and other key executives at Genentech all cite Syntex as a key guide in their path towards becoming a FIPCO. The LA Times even ran an article with the title “Syntex Serves as Model for Young Firms: Now Major Player in Drug Field, It Also Has Some Headaches,” quoting the President of Cetus Corp. a biotech company founded earlier than Genentech, that Syntex was the model to follow.

Syntex as a corporation has not received the same level of analysis as Genentech, despite having also achieved Wall Street notoriety. Syntex’s share price rose from a low of $11 in 1962 to a high of $190 in 1964, and one its earliest scientists, Djerassi, bought 1200 acres of land in the Santa Cruz mountains and assembled a leading art collection, nicknaming it SMIP, an acronym for Syntex Made It Possible.
This paper attempts to correct this disparity by first focusing on the origins of Genentech and key aspects of its business strategy that are claimed as novel inventions. The second part parallels the first, but this time focusing on Syntex Corporation. In the conclusion, a resulting comparison shows how many of Genentech’s supposedly original methods had already been achieved decades ago.
## Course Syllabus: 
### Professor John W. Servos:

This course is about the history of therapeutics during the decades from about 1880 to 1960. We take it for granted that physicians can supply us with remedies for most infectious diseases and assume that such remedies have contributed greatly to making our lives longer and healthier. These assumptions were born during the period we will be surveying. So, too, were the big pharmaceutical companies,biomedical research institutions, and regulatory agencies that are such visible parts of our medicine. The advances in therapeutics made during this era changed medicine. They also created new risks and new political dilemmas. The debates over health care of recent years grow directly out of the therapeutic revolution that began shortly before the beginning of the twentieth century. It is history that has shaped important parts of our world.

I have focused most of our common readings on the history of drug therapies-from the introduction of diphtheria anti-toxin in the 1890s to the proliferation of antibiotics in the 1950s and 60s. As in most history courses, we will be seeking to learn what happened, assessingcontinuities and discontinuities in the story, and trying to figure out why change occurred. Some of the reading will take you into the details of drug development, and that may test your patience. But it is impossible to come to any real understanding of the 'whys' of events without knowing something of the 'hows,' and this can mean digging a bit into the technical details of laboratory research, industrial practice, and the law. Be assured, however, that the 'technical content' of the readings is modest and should be comprehensible to anyone with a decent high school science education.
