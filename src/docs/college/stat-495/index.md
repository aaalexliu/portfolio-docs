# Yelp Dataset Challenge

For the final project of the Statistics Capstone course at Amherst, I and a group of two other students decided to take on the 12th Yelp Dataset Challenge. Our main goal was to predict the `stars_review` response variable, which has 5 levels, 1-5, making it a multi-class classification problem. I focused on applying and interpreting two machine learning methods we learned in class, Classification Trees and Random Forests. Unfortunately, even with the new sentiment factors we added, the best model only achieved 3.5% better accuracy than a baseline majority prediction.

## Course Syllabus, STAT 495: Advanced Data Analysis
### Professor Amy Wagaman
Our world is awash in data. To allow decisions to be made based on evidence, there is a need for statisticians to be able to make sense of the data around us and communicate their findings. In this course, students will be exposed to advanced statistical methods and will undertake the analysis and interpretation of complex and real-world datasets that go beyond textbook problems. Course topics will vary from year to year depending on the instructor and selected case studies but will include static and dynamic visualization techniques to summarize and display high dimensional data, advanced topics in design and linear regression, ethics, and selected topics in data mining. Other topics may vary but might include nonparametric analysis, spatial data, and analysis of network data. Through a series of case studies, students will develop the capacity to think and compute with data, undertake and assess analyses, and effectively communicate their results using written and oral presentation.
