# Welcome

Hi! This is my online portfolio, which is currently formatted like programming documentation, because why not. I've organized it into the following sections, accessible from the sidebar:

## College
Papers and presentations from my college years, which I seized as my last extended opportunity to live the life of the mind. If I had the chance to do college again, I would've just done a regular courseload and focused my energy, but I think I made the most of my expensive liberal arts education.

I chose to include:
### History
To show I can research, craft and communicate an analytical, evidence-based, narrative. Also I just love stories that examine how the world we live in came to be. 

- On Nationalism
  - WeChat, China, Information and Communication Technologies, and Nationalism: What Happens When Nationalism Goes Digital?
- Therapeutic Transformations: The "Wonder Drugs" and Modern Medicine
  - Biotech, Genentech, and Syntex

### Economics
To show that I can think through abstract models of human behavior, critically examine their relevance to messy human realities, and manipulate fancy symbols in latex.

- Mechanism Design
  - Review of The Economic Limits of Bitcoin and the Blockchain by Eric Budish
  - Quadratic Voting Meets Groups

### Statistics
To show that I can apply quantitative reasoning to real world data with computers. Also that I've rolled up my sleeves, waded into mucks of data wielding `R` and some `tidyverse` packages, and emerged with usable factors. 

- Statistics Capstone, Advanced Data Analysis
  - Yelp Dataset Challenge

## Finance
Unfortunately most of the work I did pursuing a career as an investor/trader can be considered proprietary and I don't want to risk finding out the hard way.

Right now I have online two stock pitches which I did during college using no work-related resourcs. One pitched Cinemark, to the Boston Investment Conference Student Idea Investment Content, which was open to undergraduates and MBAs, and one pitched GOOS to a Cornell Stock Pitch Competition, which was open to undergraduates. I somehow did better in the one open to MBAs.

This is mainly to show that I've done fundamentals work such as making DCFs from 10Ks and distilling sell-side coverage into neat little pitch decks.

## Margins

My showcase project to demonstrate my potential as a full stack software engineer. Check it out at [www.margins.me](https://www.margins.me)

For a deep dive into the infrastructure and the architecture tradeoffs I made, you can start at the Overview, with more detailed posts breaking down the GraphQL API, Front End, and Serverless Microservices.

## Time Series and IoT Analytics

An overview of a software consulting project where I helped a China startup which wanted to analyze real-time data from tens of thousands of Set Top Boxes build an IoT Analytics stack using Alibaba Cloud's Function Compute, TSDB for InfluxDB, and Grafana.
